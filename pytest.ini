# --- General run behavior ---
# Default options passed to every pytest run
# -v: verbose (show test names)
# --tb=short: short tracebacks (cleaner console logs)
# You can switch to -q for quieter CI output if needed
# maxfail=x means tests will fail after x failures

# --- Logging ---
# Live CLI logging can help during debugging, but adds minor overhead.
# Keep it off for speed; enable temporarily if needed.

# log_cli_level = INFO

# --- Markers ---
# Define custom markers for organization or selective runs (optional)
